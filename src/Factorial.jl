    bigfactorial(n::Int [; msg=true])

The product of all *positive* integers less than or equal to `n`,
```math
n!=n(n-1)(n-2)â‹¯1.
```
In addition ``0!=1`` by definition.
For *negative* integers the factorial is zero. 

- `msg` : integer-overflow protection (IOP) - warning on activation  (for `n > 20`) 
#### Examples:
```
julia> bigfactorial(20) == factorial(20)
true

julia> bigfactorial(21)
IOP capture: bigfactorial(21) converted to BigInt
51090942171709440000

julia> bigfactorial(21; msg=false)
51090942171709440000

julia> factorial(21)
ERROR: OverflowError: 21 is too large to look up in the table; consider using 
`factorial(big(21))` instead
```

    typeof(n) == Int || return factorial(n)

    n = Int(n)
    nc = 20
